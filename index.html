                <h2>Camping in Big Sur</h2>
                <p>Big Sur, California has private and public campgrounds that are perfect for both car/RV camping and tent camping.</p>
                <h3>Prewitt Ridge</h3>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597004858e20626c.jpeg" alt="Prewitt Ridge">
                <p>The picture above is the view from a campsite at Prewitt Ridge. This is an offcially designated campground in the Los Padres National Forests. There are no reservations, as it is first-come, first-serve. In terms of transportation, a four-wheel drive is recommended as the route up to the site is rough, narrow, and winding. Once at the grounds, the view is high above the clouds looking out over the southern Big Sur coast.</p>
                <h3>Pfieffer State Park</h3>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970835963fdffff.jpeg" alt="Pfieffer">
                <p>Pfieffer State Park is another popular campsite. There are 189 RV and tent sites close to the Big Sur River. A standard site costs $35/night, which includes entry of one vehicle. The maximum number of people per site is six, and minors under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Each site includes a parking spot, a fire pit, and a picnic table. See the California Department of Parks and Rectreation's <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=29832">website</a> for more details and reservations.</p>
                <h3>Andrew Molera State Park</h3>

                <p>Andrew Molera State Park is currently closed for camping due to COVID-19 procedures. This park is underdeveloped but offers multiple hikes and beach access. See the California Department of Parks and Rectreation's <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=582">website</a> for more information.

                <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
                <p>The following information features stories and quotations from two college students who frequently visit Big Sur, California.</p>
                <h3>Interview with Riley Giblin About Her Experience in Big Sur</h3>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1596864162120076b.jpeg" alt="Pfieffer State Park">
                <h4>Jackson Dudek, 20, Jack Giblin, 19, and Riley Giblin, 21, enjoying their time at Pfieffer State Park (from L to R).</h4>
                <p>RG: Hi. My name is Riley Giblin, and I'm from Santa Cruz, California. I often go to Big Sur with my friends and family.</p>
                <p>Q: So, today is August 9, 2020. When was the last time you visited Big Sur?</p>
                <p>RG: The last time I was there was probably about 3-4 weeks ago.</p>
                <p>Q: How does Big Sur differ from other campsites and hikes?</p>
                <p>RG: I love going to Big Sur because there are so many different things to do. You can go hiking, camping, fishing, and swimming, and there's both oceanic views and forested areas to explore.</p>
                <p>Q: Where is your favorite place to camp and why?</p>
                <p>RG: I typically go to Prewitt Ridge because it is such a beautiful spot to watch the sunset above the clouds.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you often have any challenges when going to Big Sur?</p>
                <p>RG: When we go camping, my friends and I often have difficulty finding a place to set up our tents. Because of quarantine, it has been especially difficult because a lot of people are going there to get away from their homes. Like I said before, I usually go to Prewitt Ridge, but I recently heard that they closed off the area due to the increasing number of people. When I was there a few weeks ago, it took us a very long time to find a site, and we ended up with the very last one. The overall experience was definitely worth the difficulty though!</p>
                <p>Q: What do you like best about hiking and camping, especially in Big Sur?</p>
                <p>RG: I just really like being outdoors and spending time with my friends and family. Especially during these times, it's nice to get out of the house.</p>
